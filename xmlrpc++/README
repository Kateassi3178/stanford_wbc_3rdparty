This is a CVS snapshot taken in late April 2009. The documentation
refers to this as version 0.7 of XmlRpc?++, but that was released back
in early March 2003, and a lot seems to have changed in the meantime.

Use the enclosed buildme.sh script for building and installing
on your system. For a staged installation under the current working
directory, just type:

 $ ./buildme.sh

Which ends up installing into include/ and lib/. In order
to install elsewhere, just give the prefix as command line
argument. For example, to install into /usr/local/xmlrpc++ do
the following:

 $ ./buildme.sh /usr/local/xmlrpc++

The build script will attempt to install there, and if that fails it
will retry using sudo. So you do not have to run th e entire build as
root.
