Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: vectors, matrices,
and related algorithms.

http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

Released (at your option) either under the LGPL, version 3 or later,
or under the GPL, version 2 or later.

Tarball of eigen-2.0.15 with a little build script.

Use the enclosed buildme.sh script for building and installing
on your system. For a staged installation under the current working
directory, just type (NOTE: you need cmake for this):

 $ ./buildme.sh

Which ends up installing into include/ and lib/. In order
to install elsewhere, just give the prefix as command line
argument. For example, to install into /usr/local/eigen2 do
the following:

 $ ./buildme.sh /usr/local/eigen2

The build script will attempt to install there, and if that fails it
will retry using sudo. So you do not have to run th e entire build as
root.
