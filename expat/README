--------------------------------------------------

You're probably better off installing expat from your distro's
packaging system, e.g.:

 $ sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev

Otherwise, read on...

--------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a tarball of expat-2.0.1 with a little build
script.

Use the enclosed buildme.sh script for building and installing
on your system. For a staged installation under the current working
directory, just type:

 $ ./buildme.sh

Which ends up installing into include/ and lib/. In order
to install elsewhere, just give the prefix as command line
argument. For example, to install into /usr/local/gtest do
the following:

 $ ./buildme.sh /usr/local/gtest

The build script will attempt to install there, and if that fails it
will retry using sudo. So you do not have to run th e entire build as
root.
