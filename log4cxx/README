--------------------------------------------------

Use the enclosed buildme.sh script for building and installing
on your system. For a staged installation under the current working
directory, just type:

 $ ./buildme.sh

It will try to instruct you how to download the log4cxx tarball and
what system dependencies to install. A successfull build ends up
installing into subdirectories beneath the current working one. In
order to install elsewhere, just give the prefix as command line
argument. For example, to install into /usr/local/log4cxx do the
following:

 $ ./buildme.sh /usr/local/log4cxx

The build script will attempt to install there, and if that fails it
will retry using sudo. So you do not have to run th e entire build as
root.
